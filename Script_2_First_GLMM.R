# Specify and Fit the Full Model

# Reminder:
# What we got from data exploration:
# Families to try: Binomial & Beta-Binomial
# We want to see if there is a trend over time
# We want to account for Variation between years and Sites, although we are not interested in estimates


# We are starting with a full model of random effects based on on Piepho & Ogutu (2002)
# Fixed:
# we are interested in a trend so we will include year as fix effect to get an estimate

# Random:
# random site intercept effect to account for the random sample of sites and correlation among all 
# (1|Site) -years visited in the same site

# random year intercept effect to account for correlation among all sites visited in the same year
# (1|Year) - random intercept for each year 

# we didn't see a lot of variation between the trends for each site
# however to be sure we can check random site slope effect to account for variation among site-level trend lines
# (1 + WYear|Site) - this assumes correlation between intercept and slope


# When doing a binomial model with success rates ( in this case presence of shrub is success and absence is failure)
# We layout the model specifying each of them 

# success: Shrub_cover
# failure: 100-Shrub_cover

# (success, failure)

# lets fit a binomial first:
fit_Bin <- glmmTMB(cbind(Shrub$Shrub_cover, 100-Shrub$Shrub_cover) ~ WYear +

testDispersion(fit_Bin,plot = T)
testQuantiles(fit_Bin, plot = T)
testUniformity(fit_Bin, plot = T)

# these all look like there is overdispersion
# lets fit a beta binomial instead

fit_betaBin <- glmmTMB(cbind(Shrub_cover,100-Shrub_cover) ~ WYear + (1|Site) + (1|Year), 
                       data = Shrub,
                       REML = T, 
                       family=betabinomial(link='logit'))  

summary(fit_betaBin)

# normal distribution, and are standardized to values between 0 and 1

# these all look good!
# Beta-Binomial is probably a good choice!

# What if we wanted to check if there is random site slope effect to account for variation among site-level trend lines
# (1 + WYear|Site) - this assumes correlation between intercept and slope

# Let's look at the estimates:
summary(fit_betaBin_v2)

# Both these models fit_betaBin_v2 and fit_betaBin: are beta-binomial, and have random intercepts for site and year as well as trend over time
# the difference is that fit_betaBin_v2 accounts for variation in trend for each site, but if we look at the coefficient this value is really small
# we could probably remove the slope for Site because its so small however, we can use AIC to compare models:

# To compare models we need to run them with ML
